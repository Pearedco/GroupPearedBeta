Do these first! Especially Nathan/Andrew






MVP Back-end:

Allow the admins to approve/deny events on the admins 

On admin/volunteer pages: dynamic number pages, implementation of the "Next" button

Dynamic numbers (right now its only 1 - 2 - 3 but there could be more pages) to prevent overloading

Allow users to sign up on different teams for a single event (max one)

MVP Front-end:




Do these later if you have time!


Back-end:

Limit user signups and give a confirmation message that they are signed up by gmail or something

Allow users to see their signups on the website using an account

Make events be hidden after signing up for them

Make onsite authentication work (possibly using cookies or MongoDB)

Front-end:

Redesign of landing page so that there are rows that take up the screen’s width instead of boxes ✅

Go through each page and see which are affected by the size of the window/screen and make them dependent on screen size (many pages break on mobile!)

Make more dynamic contact information that allows people to connect more fluidly and easily
