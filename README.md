# Peared-Beta
Unassigned To-Do List that any of y'all can tackle if you have time and want to.
 - None of these are required for anybody, but Anushka and Andrew will assign them down the line
if nobody completes a significant portion of them.
 - Anybody can add to this list if they see an issue they want fixed (if it is urgent then ping in Discord).

Back-end:
 - Create test events to test the volunteer and admin controls, then debug/implement as appropriate.
 - Front-end needs help with info.css to make a dynamic team layout that will be easier to control and use.

Front-end:
 - Go through each page and make sure the styling is somewhat cohesive (i.e. make the header the same).
 - Go through each page and see which are affected by the size of the window/screen and make them dependent on screen size.
 - Make all the drop down boxes click to drop down (especially in about me)
 - Change the headers to on the pages that aren't index to be the new prototype one (and fix it to work on mobile)
 - Someone do handlebars on host.js my eyes burn - Nathan
   - Andrew would recommend Find Opportunities's header because it has the most parts integrated from other headers.
   - Nathan reccomends that the header should always be the same for UX reasons
