MVP Due Date: 6/4
Do these first! Especially Nathan/Andrew

MVP Back-end:
-Allow the admins to approve/deny events on the admins 
-On admin/volunteer pages: dynamic number pages, implementation of the "Next" button
-Dynamic numbers (right now its only 1 - 2 - 3 but there could be more pages) to prevent overloading
-Allow users to sign up on different teams for a single event (max one)
-Make onsite authentication work (possibly using cookies or MongoDB)

MVP Front-end:
-Update the team member information.
-Make a consistent, more compact header that is the same on every page for reusability

Do these later if you have time!

Back-end:
-Limit user signups and give a confirmation message that they are signed up by gmail or something
-Allow users to see their signups on the website using an account
-Make events be hidden after signing up for them

Front-end:
-The raising of icons on hover is quite annoying, and should be removed from all pages (for buttons the transition should be replaced by a darkening/lightening effect)
(someone steal the effect from codecademy)
-Webpage requires a more modern web format relatable to modern lifestyle services.
-Use sans-serif font instead of a serif one
-Make a consistent footer, as well, following other websites’ examples
-Redesign of landing page so that there are rows that take up the screen’s width instead of boxes
-Go through each page and see which are affected by the size of the window/screen and make them dependent on screen size (many pages break on mobile!)
-Make more dynamic contact information that allows people to connect more fluidly and easily
